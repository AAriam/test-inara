# Summary

Begin your paper with a summary of the high-level functionality
of your software for a non-specialist reader.
Avoid jargon in this section.

JOSS welcomes submissions from broadly diverse research areas.
For this reason, we require that authors include in the paper some sentences
that explain the software functionality and domain of use to a non-specialist reader.
We also require that authors explain the research applications of the software.
The paper should be between 250-1000 words.
Authors submitting papers significantly longer than 1000 words
may be asked to reduce the length of their paper.

JOSS papers are only expected to contain a limited set of metadata,
a Statement of need, Summary, Acknowledgements, and References sections.
Given this format, a “full length” paper is not permitted,
and software documentation such as API (Application Programming Interface) functionality
should not be in the paper and instead should be outlined in the software documentation.

# Statement of Need

A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose
of the software and places it in the context of related work.

# Other Section

## Figures

Figures can be included like this:

![This is the caption of the figure.\label{fig:example}](../full_light.png){ width=50% }

and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

# Acknowledgements

# References
